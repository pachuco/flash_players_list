Plays MOD and has basic XM support.
Precalculates song and doesn't support loops in middle of tune?

-hxMikMod by jouko
Why do people insist on porting MikMod????? MikMod is notoriously bad in general.
.mod: high note troubles, broken effects; note retrigger is wrongly timed, portamento hiccups, no invert loop.
.s3m: somewhat decent. Spotted one case of broken vibrato.
.xm: chokes on Jeroen Tell - Stranglehold, broken envelopes. One tune actually breaks the player and prevents it from playing any tune at all
.it: doesn't even load tunes half of the time.
Conclusion: bad bad bad bad!

FLOD plays MOD and a few other amiga formats. Pretty good.
FLXM plays XM. Has been integrated into FLOD. Somewhat buggy.
FLYM plays AtariST register dumps. It's incomplete and has bugs.
